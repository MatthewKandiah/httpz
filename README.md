# HTTPZ
Curious about how HTTP actually works, lets try implementing a server and client.

# Notes
- Possibly useful HTTP server test suite https://github.com/init/http-test-suite
- HTTP/1.1 spec https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-introduction

# TODO
- keep server alive across multiple requests
- request builder -> get client to send a valid `GET / HTTP/1.1` to google.com
- response builder -> get server to respond to a GET
